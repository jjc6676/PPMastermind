### **Possible Enhancements for Flight Mode and System Functionality**

#### **1\. User Interface Enhancements**

✅ **LED Indicators for Flight Modes**

-   Use different-colored LEDs to indicate the selected flight mode (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).
-   Example: Green for Beginner, Yellow for Intermediate, Red for Expert.

✅ **OLED or TFT Screen for Real-Time Display**

-   Show current flight mode, gain values, and system status on a small display.
-   Helpful for real-time monitoring during testing.

✅ **Haptic Feedback (Vibration Motor)**

-   Add a small vibration motor to provide tactile feedback when switching modes.
-   Useful in environments where looking at a display is difficult.

#### **2\. Control Enhancements**

✅ **Wireless Flight Mode Switching**

-   Instead of using a potentiometer, allow flight mode switching via an RC transmitter switch.

✅ **Auto Mode Based on Sensor Data**

-   Implement an automatic flight mode selection based on gyro/altitude/acceleration readings.
-   Example: If turbulence is detected, automatically engage Beginner mode for stability.

✅ **Button-Based Mode Switching**

-   Replace the potentiometer with push buttons for more precise mode selection.
-   Example: One button cycles through modes, another resets to Beginner mode.

#### **3\. Logging and Debugging Enhancements**

✅ **Log Flight Mode Changes to SD Card**

-   Record timestamps of flight mode changes for later review.
-   Useful for debugging flight behavior.

✅ **Live Serial Output with Graphing**

-   Send flight mode and gain data to a PC for real-time graphing and debugging.
-   Use software like **Processing** or **Python with Matplotlib**.

✅ **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Telemetry**

-   Send flight mode and gain values to a smartphone or laptop via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.
-   Can be used for remote monitoring or debugging in real-time.

#### **4\. Safety and Stability Enhancements**

✅ **Failsafe Mode on Signal Loss**

-   If signal from the transmitter or Teensy is lost, automatically engage Beginner mode.

✅ **Soft Transitions Between Flight Modes**

-   Smoothly transition between flight modes instead of instant changes.
-   Prevents jerky movements when switching from Expert to Beginner mode.

✅ **Max/Min Gain Limits Per Mode**

-   Set different gain limits for each flight mode to prevent instability.
-   Example: Beginner mode limits gains to 80% max, Expert mode allows 100%.

#### **5\. Hardware and Expansion**

✅ **Custom PCB for Cleaner Wiring**

-   Instead of using a breadboard, design a compact PCB for all components.

✅ **Modular Sensor Integration**

-   Add a barometer for altitude-based stabilization.
-   Integrate an external IMU (like MPU6050) for more precise motion tracking.

✅ **Gyro and Accelerometer Data Fusion**

-   Combine data from multiple sensors to improve stabilization.
-   Example: Use accelerometer data to correct for drift in the gyroscope readings.

#### **6\. Automation & AI Integration**

✅ **Machine Learning for Adaptive Gains**

-   Implement an AI-based system that learns how to adjust gains dynamically.
-   Can adapt based on flight behavior and real-time sensor data.

✅ **Voice Control Integration**

-   Connect a voice recognition module to allow verbal commands for flight mode switching.
-   Example: Saying "Beginner Mode" switches to mode 1.

✅ **Auto-Landing Mode**

-   Program an emergency landing sequence in case of power issues or signal loss.
