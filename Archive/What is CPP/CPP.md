# What is C++?

**C++** is a powerful, high-performance programming language that builds upon **C**, adding object-oriented programming (OOP) features and other enhancements. It is widely used in system-level programming, game development, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.

## Key Features of C++:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which allow you to model complex systems more intuitively.

2. **Low-Level Access**:
   - Like C, C++ provides access to low-level memory, making it ideal for hardware-level programming.

3. **Standard Template Library (STL)**:
   - Offers powerful data structures (like vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms, making it easier to develop applications efficiently.

4. **Performance**:
   - C++ is compiled into machine code, ensuring high performance for computationally intensive tasks.

5. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Code can be compiled for multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and embedded systems.

## Common Uses:
- **Game Development**: Popular game engines like Unreal Engine are built with C++.
- **System Software**: Operating systems, device drivers, and file systems.
- **Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers, robotics, IoT devices (similar to your Teensy 4.1 project).
- **High-Performance Applications**: Real-time simulations, financial systems, and rendering engines.
- **GUI Applications**: Desktop software using libraries like Qt or wxWidgets.

## Example of C++ Code:
Hereâ€™s a simple C++ program to demonstrate its syntax:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Standard library for input/output

// Main function
int main() {
    // Print a message to the console
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;

    // Declare and use a variable
    int number = 5;
    std::cout << "The number is: " << number << std::endl;

    // Return success
    return 0;
}


##Why C++ for Your Project?
For hardware-related projects like your Teensy-based RC transmitter emulator, C++ is ideal because:

It allows low-level hardware interaction.
Libraries for embedded systems (e.g., Arduino) are written in C++.
Its speed and efficiency are crucial for real-time tasks like generating PPM signals.
