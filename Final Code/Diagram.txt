Components and Connections

Teensy 4.1:
Acts as the central controller, interfacing with potentiometers for input and the Archer Plus SR8 for stabilization adjustments.


Potentiometers:
Provide analog input for manual gain adjustments (Pitch, Roll, Yaw) and mode selection.
Each potentiometer connects its signal pin to one of the Teensy's analog input pins (e.g., A0, A1, A2, A3).

Archer Plus SR8 Receiver:
Receives stabilization adjustments from the Teensy.
Controls servos directly based on its built-in gyro and the Teensy's inputs.

Servos (Control Surfaces):
Controlled by the SR8 receiver to stabilize or maneuver the RC plane.
