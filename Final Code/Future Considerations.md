# Future Considerations

## 1. Hardware Considerations
### Pull-Up Resistors for Potentiometers
- If potentiometers produce noisy signals, consider adding pull-up or pull-down resistors (10kΩ) to stabilize the analog inputs.

### Power Regulation
- Ensure your 5V power supply is stable and can handle the current demands of the system, especially if servos draw power directly.

### Servo Placement and Noise
- Keep servo wires and components away from the Teensy and sensitive analog circuits to reduce electrical noise interference.

### Backup Power Option
- Add a secondary battery or power bank to ensure uninterrupted operation during tests.

## 2. Software Enhancements
### Input Validation
- Add checks in your code to ensure potentiometer readings and PWM outputs remain within safe ranges (e.g., 0–100% gain, valid PWM values).

### Telemetry Data Expansion
- If telemetry is used, consider adding more real-time data like battery voltage, signal strength, or servo positions.

### Calibration Routines
- Include an optional calibration mode for potentiometers and PWM signals during startup.

### Error Handling
- Implement error reporting (e.g., on the transmitter screen or via serial logs) for conditions like power supply issues, signal loss, or SD card failures.

## 3. Testing and Debugging
### Bench Test Before Flight
- Test the entire system on a test bench to ensure all inputs (potentiometers) and outputs (servos) respond correctly.

### Signal Monitoring
- Use a logic analyzer to verify PWM signals for accuracy and timing.

### Data Logging Verification
- Check the `log.csv` file for completeness and consistency after initial tests.

## 4. Possible Additions
### Failsafe Mechanism
- Program a fallback mode (e.g., fixed servo positions) in case of signal loss or critical errors.

### Expand Controls
- Add extra switches or buttons for future features (e.g., automated maneuvers, additional flight modes).

### Visual Feedback
- If not already included, integrate an OLED or TFT display to show debugging data, gain values, or flight mode in real time.

### Custom PCB
- After prototyping, design a custom PCB to consolidate components and improve reliability.

---

## 5. Documentation
### Flowcharts
- Add a flowchart to visually represent the logic for gain adjustments, PWM processing, and flight mode control.

### Troubleshooting Guide
- Document common issues and fixes, such as:
  - Potentiometer signal inconsistencies.
  - Power supply noise affecting servo performance.
  - SD card not initializing.
